# dsRNAPredictorictor
dsRNAPredictor is a predictor  to identify and characterize dsRNA and its interference efficiency for Tribolium castaneum. 
dna2vec is used to extract RNA sequence information and a deep learning-based sequence network synergized by CNN, BiLSTM and SelfAttention mechanism networks is used to retrieve long-distance dependencies and strengthen the connection. 
dsRNAPredictor showed reliable performance in multiple independent tests based on different species, including both Tribolium castaneum, and Aedes aegypti mosquito.
